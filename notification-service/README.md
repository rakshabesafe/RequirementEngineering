# Notification Service

**Status:** Not Implemented (Phase 3)

## Planned Purpose

This service will be responsible for sending notifications to users about important events within the platform. It will be triggered by events placed on the RabbitMQ message broker by other services.

Examples of notifications include:
- A new set of requirements has been generated and is ready for review.
- An architectural model requires approval.
- A synchronization with Jira has failed.

## Core Technologies (Planned)

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ (as a consumer)

The service will be designed to support multiple notification channels, such as email, Slack, or in-app alerts.

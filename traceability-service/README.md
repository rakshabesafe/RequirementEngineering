# Traceability Service

**Status:** Not Implemented (Phase 2)

## Planned Purpose

This service will be responsible for managing the graph of relationships between all artifacts in the software development lifecycle. It will provide a queryable API to understand the links between requirements, architecture, code, and tests.

For example, it will answer questions like:
- "Which requirements does this architectural component satisfy?"
- "Which documents were used to generate this user story?"
- "Show me all artifacts related to the 'User Login' feature."

## Core Technologies (Planned)

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** Neo4j (Graph Database)

The service will store only the IDs of artifacts and the relationships between them, not the full content of the artifacts themselves. This keeps the graph lightweight and fast to traverse.
